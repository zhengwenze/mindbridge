# Counselor Handoff Summary

## Workflow

- Write for counselors or administrators, not for the student.
- Preserve the student's original meaning while avoiding unnecessary dangerous detail.
- Include the report identity, student identity, risk level, emotion label, confidence, model summary, follow-up actions, and a bounded excerpt of the student's expression.
- Make the first follow-up action about current location, whether the student is accompanied, and immediate safety.
- Keep the handoff factual and actionable; do not add diagnosis or unsupported assumptions.
